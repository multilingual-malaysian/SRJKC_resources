Here's a complication of tools and apps that are available in the market:

I stumbled upon many like-minded groups on Facebook, here's tabulating them here for easier reference. This is by no means an exhaustive list, if I have missed any, please let me know by emailing me [multilingual.malaysian@gmail.com](mailto:multilingual.malaysian@gmail.com) and I will try to keep this list as up-to-date as possible.
