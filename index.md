What are the resources available?
1. **Audio reading** of each chapter in SRJKC Chinese (mp3 - playable on the browser itself)
2. PDF files of Chinese with **Hanyu Pinyin** and **English translation**.

#### Why do I do this?
I am researcher in Natural Language Processing (NLP), a field of applying Artificial Intelligence in Languages (both written and spoken). As such I am well aware of AI technologies that can be used to assist in education and in learning. Hence I have decided to embark on this journey to create extra resources to aid learning Chinese based on SRJCK textbooks.

Another main motivation is my son needs extra help in his Chinese. Though ethnic Chinese but Mandarin Chinese is not his first language. Happy to share the resources absolutely free and hope they benefit anyone who are on the same journey. Tuition teachers are welcome to use them but my only request is the materials should remain free and not to be sold. 

#### How it is done?
I hope the materials are of use to you. If you spot any mistakes, you can report them by sending me the details to multilingual.malaysian@gmail.com.
