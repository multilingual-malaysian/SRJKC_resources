I am currently a researcher in Natural Language Processing (NLP), a field of applying Artificial Intelligence in Languages (both written and spoken). As such I am well aware of AI technologies that can be used to assist in education and in learning. My children who are currently enrolled in a SRJKC school need extra help in learning Chinese because though ethnic Chinese, Mandarin Chinese is not their first language. Hence I have embarked on this journey to create extra resources to aid learning Chinese based on SRJCK textbooks. Happy to share the resources absolutely free and hope they benefit anyone who are on the same journey. Tuition teachers are welcome to use them but my only request is the materials remain **free** for your students.

The tools that I have used are: 
  - text-to-speech (TTS) to generate audio books
  - machine translation
  - optical character recognition (OCR) to

我目前是一位Natural Language Processing (NLP) 研究生, NLP 是一门融合语言学和人工智能的科学。我从中也接触到用在教育领域的人工智能程序。 我的孩子们现在就读国民型华小， 他们需要额外的辅助， 尤其是华语因为他们在家里不是说话语的， 所以我运用了这些程序来制造了额外的辅助的资源，它们是根据当前华小的课本。我把这些资源免费地分享给大家， 希望能够帮助到其他华小的学生。补习老师或补习中心请随便使用， 免费提供给学生， 但是不能将其转卖。

#### What are the available resources?
At this moment, the focus is on Chinese Year 1 to Year 6. For each year, there are:
1. **Audio reading** of each chapter (mp3 - playable on the browser itself)
2. Original Chinese text with **Hanyu Pinyin** and **English translation** (PDF file - viewable on browser and downloadable).\
In the future, more subjects might be added. 

Apart from my materials, I have also tabulated links to more resources prepared by dedicated teachers / parents, they include youtube videos and reference answers to workbooks.



#### Other Translated Work
Apart from this initiative, there are others who invested time and effort in translating SRJKC Chinese textbooks into Malay and into English + Malay. If you prefer a physical copy of the translations, you can purchase them from the respective authors (links below):
- Pinyin + Malay Translation by ***mummy.sjkc.bookstore***. Link to the facebook page [here](https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=mummy.sjkc.bookstore).
- Pinyin + English / Malay / Tri-lingual Translation by ***yumiisbookstore***. Link to the shopee store [here](https://shopee.com.my/yumiisbookstore).

#### If you spot any mistakes....
I hope the materials are of use to you. If you spot any mistakes, you can report them by sending me the details to multilingual.malaysian@gmail.com.

Have fun learning!!
