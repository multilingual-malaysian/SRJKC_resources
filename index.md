Welcome to 'SRJKC Resources', a place here you can get extra resources (free of charge) to help your child or children in their SJRKC education. I hope the materials are of use to you. 

#### What are the resources available?
1. **Audio reading** of each chapter in SRJKC Chinese (mp3 - playable on the browser itself)
2. PDF files of Chinese with **Hanyu Pinyin** and **English translation**.

#### Why do I do this?
I am researcher in Natural Language Processing (NLP) - it is a field of applying Artificial Intelligence in Languages, both written and spoken. As such I am well aware of AI technologies that can be used to assist in education and in learning. Hence I have decided to embark on this journey to create extra resources to aid learning Chinese based on SRJCK textbooks.

Another main motivation is my son needs extra help in his Chinese because Mandarin Chinese is not his first language. Happy to share the resources absolutely free to everyone. 

#### How it is done?
If you spot any mistakes, you can report them by sending me the details to multilingual.malaysian@gmail.com.
